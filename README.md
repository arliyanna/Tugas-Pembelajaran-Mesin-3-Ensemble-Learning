(Bagging & Random Forest)

1. Task Description
   In this assignment, you are asked to build a Random Forest classifier on a 
dataset (seeds_dataset) using the Bagging method, which aims to measure the classification accuracy of the seeds dataset. Aims to measure the classification accuracy on seeds dataset. This dataset classifies seeds into 3 categories (type 1, 2, and 3) depending on various attributes.
